## Problem Statement 
- Malnutrition continues to be a major public health challenge in Africa.
- This occurs in  regions affected by food insecurity, poverty, and limited access to healthcare.
- However, current early-detection systems remain insufficient.
- This project seeks to address these gaps by leveraging community-level data to identify vulnerable children early and enable timely, targeted interventions.



 --- 

## Project Objective 
- Identify key socioeconomic, dietary, and environmental factors contributing to malnutrition risk.
- To evaluate the patterns of malnutrition in the study area
- Empower healthcare workers with interpretable, data-backed insights for early identification and intervention. 
- To recommend target intervention based on analytical findings.

## Methodology
### Data Cleaning
- Original dataset structure: 235957 rows  and 21 columns
- 42 duplicates  rows (Deleted)
- Missing values (frequency of Meals column)
- Spelling inconsistencies (corrected)
- Columns with high range of numerical values were grouped.

### Tools used
- Excel
- Power BI

## Background

Three key anthropometric indicators are used to assess the nutritional status of children under five.


| Measurement |	What it Detects |	Type of Malnutrition |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Weight-for-Age |	Light for age	| Underweight (general malnutrition) |
| Height-for-Age	| Short for age	| Stunting (long-term malnutrition) |
| Weight-for-Height	| Too thin for height	| Wasting (short-term malnutrition) |

| Z-score | value	Category	| Meaning |
| -------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Z >2	| Overweight |	Child is above expected growth |
| 2≤ Z ≥ –2 |	Normal	| Child is within healthy growth range |
| –3 ≤ Z < –2	| Moderately malnourished	| Child is below expected growth |
| Z < –3	| Severely malnourished	| Child is far below healthy range; high risk |

## Key KPIs
- Total children: 235915
- Average Weight-for-Age: -1.30
- Average Height-for-Age: -1.30
- Average Weight-for-Height: -0.87
- High malnutrition risk %: 26.7%
- Moderate malnutrition risk %: 33.3%
- Low malnutrition risk %: 40.0%

## Key Findings 
- Majority of children have parents with primary and secondary education, only a few have tertiary education (about 16%).
- Just a few (approx. 16%) have high dietary diversity (eat more than 6 types of meals).
- Most of the children (around 71K) are under 1 year.
- More than 30% of children have no access to food and healthcare.
- Children with low diversity have low z-scores of -1.7 for WFA and HFA. This is close to underweight and stunting.
- As parent education decreases, malnutrition worsens. 
- Poor parental education and dietary diversity correlate with high malnutrition risk.
- The even bubble size in the map shows that the proportion of children with high-risk malnutrition in all location are similar (about 26%).
- Poor sanitation, poor market access, lack of clean water, lack of access to care and poor food availability shows high percentage of high-risk children
- However, high-risk increases when there is seasonal variations, as this can affect food availability and disease patterns


--- 

## Recommendations 
- Improve dietary diversity through nutrition programs.
- Educate parents on healthy nutrition.
- Enhance food availability and market access.
- Improve Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) infrastructure.
- Strengthen access to healthcare services.
- Implement seasonal preparedness strategies.



---

## Conclusion
- Malnutrition remains a critical public health challenge, particularly among children under five in low-resource settings. 
- The analysis shows that malnutrition risk is influenced by poor education, poor dietary diversity, and limited access to healthcare, clean water, and sanitation facilities.
- Z-score indicators consistently show poorer outcomes among children from households with constrained resources and reduced food availability.
- To address these gaps, strengthening community-based nutrition education help caregivers make informed decisions.
- Improving access to clean water, sanitation facilities, and primary healthcare services is essential to reducing disease burden and supporting growth.
- Finally, interventions should account for seasonal food shortages by implementing year-round food support systems, improved market access, and nutrition-sensitive agricultural programs.
