## Problem Statement 
- Malnutrition continues to be a major public health challenge in Africa.
- This occurs in  regions affected by food insecurity, poverty, and limited access to healthcare.
- However, current early-detection systems remain insufficient.
- This project seeks to address these gaps by leveraging community-level data to identify vulnerable children early and enable timely, targeted interventions.



 --- 

## Project Objective 
- Identify key socioeconomic, dietary, and environmental factors contributing to malnutrition risk.
- To evaluate the patterns of malnutrition in the study area
- Empower healthcare workers with interpretable, data-backed insights for early identification and intervention. 
- To recommend target intervention based on analytical findings.

## Methodology
# Data Cleaning
- Original dataset structure: 235957 rows  and 21 columns
- 42 duplicates  rows (Deleted)
- Missing values (frequency of Meals column)
- Spelling inconsistencies (corrected)
- Columns with high range of numerical values were grouped.

# Tools used
- Excel
- Power BI

## Background

Three key anthropometric indicators are used to assess the nutritional status of children under five.




## Datasets 
-  **City Hospital Dataset.xlsx** — patient_id, age, gender, admission date, department

--- 

## Dashboard Features
- Key KPIs: total patients, total doctors, doctors to patient ratio, average admission duration, total billing amount
- Visuals: Patient Distribution by Age Group, Monthly Hospital Admission Trend, Hospital by Patient Volume, Top 10 Performing Doctors by Patient Load
- Interactivity: slicers for Gender, Age group, Test result
 
--- 

## Key Findings 
- The population is more of elderly (21,148).
- The admission types are almost evenly distributed.
- Monthly admissions are consistent, showing no extreme spikes.
- Medicare Insurance has the highest enrolment, with 50% of the patients (27,750).
- Houston Methodist Hospital is handling a disproportionately high patient volume. 
- Some doctors are handling significantly more patients than others.
- Hypertension and Diabetes are the leading conditions (13,875 each).
- There is not much difference between the number of drugs used, however, Penicillin is the least prescribed medication.

--- 

## Recommendations 
- Redistribute doctor and hospital workload.
- Strengthen chronic disease management pathways such as hypertension and diabetes.
- Adopt a hospital-wide digital health system.
- More data should be collected on insurance and amount reimbursed.
- Equipment used for diabetes and obesity investigations should be inspection.
